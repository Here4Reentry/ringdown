**The Baltimore Community Ringdown!**

A project using the [twilio.com](twilio.com) to create a [Ringdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringdown) network for returning citizens.

This project is a result of the 8/28 Hackday. 

The idea came about because our Returning Citizen Leaders expressed a desire to have a place where the community could dscuss and direct each other to rresources.

Thank you everybody for your help.
